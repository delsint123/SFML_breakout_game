# SFML_breakout_game
Breakout game using SFML (Simple Fast Multimedia Library) in C++

Created during Spring 2022 Semester at Florida Gulf Course Univerisity as part of the course COP 2001: Programming Methodologies.

This game was created using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The program can not be run without having the library installed, therefore there is no corresponding github-page.

The game consists of concepts including functions, loops, switch statements, header files, pointers, pass by: {reference, value, and pointer}, use of constant variables, and the mathematics used for collision detection.
The goal of this project was to create a game like breakout complete with a ball, paddle and bricks. The game keeps track of the players score and displays it in the console when the game is over. There is a video attatched showing the game play.

This project was uploaded to Github after being completed so each commit has nothing to do with the completion of the project. Previous iterations will be stored in folders marked with their corresponding numbers in the order of which they were completed. Each folder has their own README.md page explaining the general changes/updates to the game.

Note: an initial template was given to begin the project; a small chunk of the code was written by the professor of the course.
